# BoxFight - Angel Romero
Box Fight is a Unity Engine based application that wll incoporate many aspects from my OOAD class.
The game is centered to have a smash bros. feel with the exception of percentage of knockback as 
health, the user must survive while in the small screen and often items will appear. 
I will incorporate design patterns into this Project.
There will be a character selection, level selection, start menu, and a settings page. 
I am very new to game development, this is my first attempt.

In order to play, you must download the Unity Tool! Please use latest version to open and use project. 

The scripts are where the code is at!!
